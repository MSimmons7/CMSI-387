CMSI 387 Operating Systems
	Semester Project
===================================

This is a good idea.  You have nailed the fact that creating
user accounts is a time consuming and error-prone process when
it is done manually.  This is particularly true with Windows
since one needs to make sure the proper user roles are put in
place and permissions applied.  For Linux, something similar
is needed, so the admin can do the task with fewer manual
steps.

There are already operating system tools in place that do this
ABOVE the kernel level, but encapsulating the operations into
the kernel is a worthy project!

Project approved.  Good work and good luck!

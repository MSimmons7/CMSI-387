#### 1.1
For our modification, we will randomly change the desktop theme to an entirely newly designed desktop theme upon startup.

#### 1.2
For the average user, changing the theme is rather difficult and tedious and computers are meant to be customized. 
The user will never get bored because there will always be a fresh new theme waiting for them.
We want to make Linux more palatable for those coming from Mac or Windows.

#### 1.3
We aren't sure exactly what modules (if any) we will need to accomplish this.

#### 1.4
We will be creating a theme module that will run on its own without configuration like GNOME.

---------
Had to take 5 points off Bounded Buffer Test, since it didn't
actually compare the items properly.

On the loop 4096 problem, what were the array sizes?  Did you
get over 1,000,000,000?  No points off, just curious...

Had to take 2 points off the fork() problem because the tree
isn't quite right.

Nice work!
